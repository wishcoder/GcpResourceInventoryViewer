## Here's a breakdown of the GCP services and roles/permissions needed at the organization level for using google-cloud-container:

### Enable GCP Services:
- **Kubernetes Engine API:** This API must be enabled at the organization level to allow interaction with GKE clusters.
- **Resource Manager API:** This API enables management of resources across multiple projects within the organization, which is often necessary for organization-level access to GKE clusters.


## Here's a breakdown of the GCP services and roles/permissions needed at the organization level for using google-cloud-compute:

### Enable GCP Services:
- **Compute Engine API:** This API must be enabled at the organization level to allow interaction with GCE resources, including VMs, disks, networks, and more.
- **Resource Manager API:** This API enables management of resources across multiple projects within the organization, which is often necessary for organization-level access to GCE resources.

### Essential Libraries for Core Services:

**google-cloud-resourcemanager:** This library is crucial for interacting with the Resource Manager API, enabling you to list projects, folders, and other organizational structures within your GCP environment. This is essential for iterating through different resources across multiple projects.

### Unifying Data Collection:

**google-cloud-asset:** While not a Java Client Library, the Cloud Asset Inventory API can provide a unified view of assets across multiple GCP services, potentially simplifying your data collection process.
